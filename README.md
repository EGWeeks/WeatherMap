## Weather Drop

Weather Drop displays the current weather and forecasted conditions based off the users current location.

The user interface has a basic design to give the user the essential information to be able to plan their day. Built on the idea that when checking the weather usually we are making plans to go somewhere and do something. Our current local weather it's actually what we are looking for so I built it on google maps with a draggable marker. Once the marker is placed in a new location the user can view those specific coordinates conditions.
